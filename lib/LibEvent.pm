=head1 NAME

LibEvent - Perl bindings with libevent2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use LibEvent;

    my $base = LibEvent::EventBase->new;

    my $ev1 = $base->timer_new(LibEvent::EV_TIMEOUT, sub {
            my ($ev, $events) = @_;
            print "Timer1\n";
            });

    $ev1->add(1.5);

    $base->loop;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LibEvent is a thin wrapper around libevent2 functionality.

=head1 CONSTANTS
        
=head2 EVLOOP_ONCE

Block event loop until at least one event became active, then exit after process all active events.

See L<LibEvent::EventBase/$base-E<gt>loop($flags)>.

=head2 EVLOOP_NONBLOCK

Do not block (see which events are ready now, process of the highest-priority ones, then exit).

See L<LibEvent::EventBase/$base-E<gt>loop($flags)>.

=head2 EV_TIMEOUT

Indicates that a timeout has occurred.

=head2 EV_READ

Wait for a handle to become readable.

=head2 EV_WRITE

Wait for a handle to become writeable.

=head2 EV_SIGNAL

Wait for a signal to be raised.

=head2 EV_PERSIST

Persistent event: won't get removed automatically when activated.

=head2 EV_ET

Select edge-triggered behavior, if supported by the backend.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 LibEvent::get_version

    my $ver = LibEvent::get_version();
    my $ver = LibEvent->get_version;
    my $ver = libevent_get_version();

Return libevent's version string.

=head1 CAVEATS

Any from libevent2 + our own ;-)
